        <li>3 pounds ground beef </li>
        <li>3 eggs </li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley </li>
        <li>½ cup dry bread crumbs </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic </li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil </li>
        <li>1 pound sliced bacon, cut in half crosswise </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
       <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
       <li>Mix ground beef, eggs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, bread crumbs, garlic, onion powder, <br> salt, black pepper, oregano, and basil in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.<br> Form meat mix into 2-inch meatballs.</li>
       <li>Wrap half a bacon slice around a meatball;<br> turn the meatball around 45 degrees <br> and wrap a second half-slice of bacon around the meatball so the meat is enclosed by bacon. <br>Repeat, forming 12 meatballs and wrapping each one in 2 half-slices of bacon. Place wrapped meatballs onto the prepared baking sheet with seam sides down.</li>
       <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are no longer pink inside <br> and bacon is crisp, about 45 minutes.<br> An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a meatball should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).<br> Pour off excess grease.</li>
